# ReplaceModsWithForgeCSVMappingsGUI
A GUI program to decompile forge mods and reformat all the obfuscated code so forge can recompile the mod.

This is pretty much abandonware at this point. I may make this a console app, or something that comes with all the versions in a zip or some jazz. Not sure.

If the program doesn't work make a PR or an issue, and I may get around to updating the program. Its really not high on my prioroity sorry.
